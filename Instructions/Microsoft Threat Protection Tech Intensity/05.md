# Exercise: 7. Create and run an Advanced Hunting query.



Advanced hunting is a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you explore up to 30 days of raw data. You can proactively inspect events in your network to locate threat indicators and entities. The flexible access to data enables unconstrained hunting for both known and potential threats.

You can use the same threat-hunting queries to build custom detection rules. These rules run automatically to check for and then respond to suspected breach activity, misconfigured machines, and other findings.



1. In the navigation pane, select **Hunting** > **Advanced hunting** > Double Click **DeviceProcessEvents** > and click **Run query**.
