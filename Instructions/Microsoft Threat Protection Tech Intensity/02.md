# Exercise: 5. Simulate attacks in the evaluation lab

In this section, we will be simulating the attacks ont eh devices. We will be using the simulation scenarios available in defender portal. These scripts are safe, documented, and easy to use. These scenarios will reflect Defender for Endpoint capabilities and walk you through investigation experience.

1. By navigating from the navigation pane **Evaluation and tutorials** > **Simulation & tutorials**, then select **Simulations catalog**.

2. Select a Run simulation, In create simulation tab, Select fields with the following details then click on **Create simulation**.

    | Settings | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Select simulator | **AttackIQ**  |
    | Select simulation | **Persistence methods**  |
    | Select device | **testmachine1**  |
    | | |

3. As soon as the simulation created, a alert will be generated in **Incidents**,  By navigating from the navigation pane **Incidents**, You can see the alerts. Please take a moment to look at the incident details and explore available options.

4. View all the available simulations by going to Simulations and tutorials > Simulations catalog from the menu. A list of supported third-party threat simulation agents are listed, and specific types of simulations along with detailed descriptions are provided on the catalog.

    You can conveniently run any available simulation right from the catalog.

7. Please repeat the steps for additional simulations that you may want to try out. 


In this section, we simulated alerts and explored the incidents generated in Defender ATP center.
