# Exercise: 6. Initiate a Live Response session.


The Live response feature gives instantaneous access to a potentially compromised machine, regardless of location, by using a remote shell. Analysts use this capability to quickly gather any forensic information that is essential for threat investigation. This gives you the power to do in-depth investigative work and take immediate response actions to promptly contain identified threatsâ€”in real-time.

Live response is designed to enhance investigations by enabling your security operations team to collect forensic data, run scripts, send suspicious entities for analysis, remediate threats, and proactively hunt for emerging threats.
