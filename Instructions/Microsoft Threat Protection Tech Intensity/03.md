# Exercise: 5. Enable attack surface reduction rules 

Your organization's attack surface includes all the places where an attacker could compromise your organization's devices or networks. Reducing your attack surface means protecting your organization's devices and network, which leaves attackers with fewer ways to perform attacks. Configuring attack surface reduction rules in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can help!

Attack surface reduction rules target certain software behaviors, such as:

Launching executable files and scripts that attempt to download or run files;
Running obfuscated or otherwise suspicious scripts; and
Performing behaviors that apps don't usually initiate during normal day-to-day work.

In this section, we will be using Microsoft EndPoint Manager to enable attack surface reduction rules.

1. By navigating from the navigation pane **Configuration Management**, then select **Go to attack surface management**.
