# Exercise: 5 Enable and configure the Self Service Password Reset portal




Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) self-service password reset (SSPR) gives users the ability to change or reset their password, with no administrator or help desk involvement. If a user's account is locked or they forget their password, they can follow prompts to unblock themselves and get back to work. This ability reduces help desk calls and loss of productivity when a user can't sign in to their device or an application.




## Browse to Azure Active Directory > Password reset.




1. Click on **Password reset** under the manage section from the menu on the left-hand side.
