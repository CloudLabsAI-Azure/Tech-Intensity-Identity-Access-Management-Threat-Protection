# Exercise 2: Create a dynamic group in Azure Active Directory.

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can create complex attribute-based rules to enable dynamic memberships for groups. Dynamic group membership reduces the administrative overhead of adding and removing users. This article details the properties and syntax to create dynamic membership rules for users or devices. You can set up a rule for dynamic membership on security groups or Microsoft 365 groups.
