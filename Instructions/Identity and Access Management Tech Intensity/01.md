# Exercise 1: Log in to Azure Portal (as admin)

## Instructions 

 
 

1.	After the environment is provisioned successfully your browser will load up the **Lab Guide** along with a virtual machine called JumpVM. This virtual machine will be your platform throughout the course of the workshop. 

 
 

2.	All user credentials for accessing the Azure Portal can be viewed under the **Environment Details** tab for ease of access. Do note that the same information will also be sent to your registered email address.


  

3. The Lab Guide can also be opened on a separate window by selecting the **Split Window** icon in the bottom right corner. This will result in the window detaching from the right side providing more on-screen space for your virtual machine.

# Exercise 2: Create a dynamic group in Azure Active Directory.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based directory and identity management service that combines core directory services, application access management, and identity protection into a single solution. To simplify things, with the help of Azure Active Directory, you can create complex attribute-based rules to enable dynamic memberships for groups. Dynamic group membership reduces the administrative overhead of adding and removing users. This article details the properties and syntax to create dynamic membership rules for users or devices. You can set up a rule for dynamic membership on security groups or Microsoft 365 groups. 

In this exercise, We will be creating group for **Retail** users.

1. Click on the **Groups** blade under the manage section.




   ![](images/groups-aad.png "Groups")



2. Click on add **New Group**.




   ![](images/add-new-aad-group.png "Add New Group")

    | Settings | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Group type |         **Security** |
    | Group name |         **Retail Users** |
    | Group description |  **Retail** |
    | Membership type |    **Dynamic User** |
    | | |




   ![](images/create-add-group.png "Create New Group")



3. On the **Dynamic membership rules** tab, fill in the fields with the following details and click on **Save** and **Create**.

    | Settings | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Property | **department** |
    | Operator |  **contains** |

    | | |




   ![](images/dynamic-membership-rules.png "Dynamic membership rules")

You have now created a dynamic group based on department.
